# Email-Spam-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
# 📧 Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning  
A web-based application built with **Python**, **Django**, and **Machine Learning** to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using NLP techniques.  
This project demonstrates text preprocessing, ML model training, and real-time email classification through a simple Django interface.

## Features
- Machine Learning model trained for spam detection  
- Text preprocessing using NLP  
- Django-based web interface  
- Real-time spam prediction  
- Clean and simple UI  
- Easy to run and customize  

---

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- Bag of Words / TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Naive Bayes Classifier (or any ML algorithm used)  
- Data cleaning (stopwords, punctuation removal, stemming, etc.)
